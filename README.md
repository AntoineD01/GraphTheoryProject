Graph Theory 3000
Graph Theory 3000 is a Python program designed to analyze and visualize scheduling graphs using graph theory concepts. It provides functionality to create, display, and analyze graphs representing tasks and their dependencies.

Features
Interactive Menu: Easily select and analyze scheduling graphs for various scenarios.
Graph Visualization: Visualize the scheduling graph using NetworkX and Matplotlib.
Critical Path Analysis: Identify critical paths and compute important scheduling parameters.
Matrix Representation: Display the graph as an adjacency matrix for further analysis.
  
Dependencies
Graph Theory 3000 relies on the following Python libraries:
NetworkX
Matplotlib

Notes :
As the path might be an issue, if when entering the value of the graph you want to analyze you have an error, enter the actual path in your computer in line 10.
file_name = "YOUR PATH" + str(nb_table) + ".txt"
